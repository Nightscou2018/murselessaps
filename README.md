# murselessaps - OpenAPS small enough that you don't have to carry a Murse

### The goals I had were
1. Make it as small as possible while
2. Not having to use a soldering iron
3. Have at least a full day (16-18 hours) of battery life

I used a combination of the TI stick, Intel Edison and Sparkfun base board, along with a few other things. I was able to order everything from Amazon using Same Day delivery options except the TI Stick and CC Debugger which I got from ti.com. They have default shipping of 2 day air for $7.
