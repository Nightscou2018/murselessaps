# murselessaps - an openaps implemenation that's small enough that you can avoid carrying a murse (man-purse).

### Goals
1. Form factors as small as possible, while
2. Not having to use a soldering iron
3. Have at least a full day (16 hours) of battery life

I used a combination of the TI stick, Intel Edison and Sparkfun base board, a battery that has pass-through charging (so you can charger it will keeping your Edison up and running), along with a few other tools and connectors. I was able to order everything from Amazon using Same Day delivery options except the TI Stick and CC Debugger which I got from ti.com. They have default shipping of 2 day air for $7.
