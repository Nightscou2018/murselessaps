### Goals
1. Form factors as small as possible, while
2. Not having to use a soldering iron
3. Have at least a full day (16 hours) of battery life

I used a combination of the TI stick, Intel Edison and Sparkfun base board, a battery that has pass-through charging (so you can charger it will keeping your Edison up and running), along with a few other tools and connectors. I was able to order everything from Amazon using Same Day delivery options except the TI Stick and CC Debugger which I got from ti.com. They have default shipping of 2 day air for $7.

* [Setting up Edison & TI Stick] (edison-sparkfun-tistick.md)
* Packaging the hardware to fit in your pocket

These are all of the parts that we'll be putting together.

First this I did was take the dremel to the TI-Stick and removed the pins all the way down to the board. Notice that I left the debug pins in place since they were not in the way and we may (but hopefully not) need to flash again later using the debugger.

Second thing I did was use an exacto knife (razor blade) or sharp knife to cut back the edge of micro USB cable. This will give us enough room to plug everything in. Sorry it's blurry.

Next I put the tiny micro usb into the OTG port.
Then I put the white micro usb into the console port.
Then I plugged in the TI stick.
Also plug the Edison into the Sparkfun base board if not already done.

Next I used the special cloth electrical tape to tape right across the USB device to the battery.

The finished product fits right into my pocket and you can see the size here compared to my iPhone6s and pump.
