# Set up Edison + Sparkfun Base Board + TI Stick
There are plenty of other setups to consider, so you should check them out [here](https://github.com/oskarpearson/mmeowlink/wiki) and [here](https://github.com/openaps/docs).

###Getting the software set up
1. Set up your Edison
  * Activate your power button on your board with ```sudo apt-get install -y acpid```. This will allow you to restart the board safely when asked during the flashing of the Edison process
  * [Prepare the Edison for OpenAPS] (https://github.com/oskarpearson/mmeowlink/wiki/Prepare-the-Edison-for-OpenAPS)
  * [Install OpenAPS] (https://github.com/openaps/docs) by starting at Section 1, Point 4. 
  * Optional: Set up your wifi for [smart switching to home network] (https://github.com/TC2013/edison_wifi)
  * Activate your power button. We did this earlier, but we blew that away when we flashed, so let's do it again with  ```sudo apt-get install -y acpid```. This will allow you to shutdown the edison safely before battery swaps, etc.
2. Write the firmware to the TI-stick using cc-tool on Linux as described below (PC/Mac are other options which can use the [TI Flash Programmer Tool instead] (http://www.ti.com/tool/flash-programmer))
    * Download CC-Tool ```wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/cctool/cc-tool-0.26-src.tgz?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fcctool%2F&ts=1454912359&use_mirror=tcpdiag -O cc-tool-0.26-src.tgz```, then unzip it ```tar xvfz cc-tool-0.26-src.tgz```
    * Edit ```vi cc-tool/programmer/cc_programmer.cpp``` and change the line ```USB_SET_CHIP_INFO, 1, 1, &command[0], command.size());``` to ```USB_SET_CHIP_INFO, 1, 0, &command[0], command.size());``` then save the file.
    * Install it with ```cd cc-tool``` then ```./configure``` then  ```make```
    * Install a few other needed items with ```sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libboost-all-dev sdcc```. 
    * Grab the [current hex file](https://github.com/ps2/subg_rfspy/releases) which you plan to flash onto the TI stick. If you are in the US and for our TI stick here it'd be usb_ep0_TI_DONGLE_US_STDLOC.hex.
    * Plug your CC-Debugger that you purchased or borrowed into your your machine running CC-Tool or TI Flash Programmer Tool.
    * Plug your TI stick's USB into power.
    * Plug the other end onto your TI stick labeled DEBUG with the right stripe inwards towards the USB end of the board.
    * Press the reset button on your CC-Debugger. Make sure it is a green light before moving on.
    * Flash it. If using Linux that'd be ```sudo cc-tool --log install.log -ew FILE-YOU-JUST-GRABBED.hex```
  * [Install MMeowlink] (https://github.com/oskarpearson/mmeowlink/wiki/Installing-MMeowlink) onto your Edison.
  * Install and set up mmtune using the set of commands below (which tunes the radio frequency on the stick to best match your pump). Replace XXXXXX with your pump id. If that port is incorrect for you, just `ls /dev/tty*`, then unplug the TI stick and run `ls /dev/tty*` again to see what the name of the port should be changed to.
```
git clone https://github.com/ps2/minimed_rf
cd minimed_rf
Sudo apt-get install ruby-full
sudo gem install bundler
bundle
ruby -I lib bin/mmtune /dev/ttyACM0 XXXXX

If not working, you may need:
Apt-get ruby-colorize
gem install serialport
```
  * Add mmtune to your aliases ```openaps alias add mmtune "! bash -c \"cd ~/src/minimed_rf/ && ruby -I lib bin/mmtune /dev/ttyACM0 XXXXXX | egrep -v 'rssi:|OK|Ver|Open'\""```
  * Run the tuner to make sure it works and to set up a frequency for the first time ```openaps mmtune```. It may show errors, but if it gives a frequency it's probably safe to ignore the errors.
  * Optional: Add the tuner as part of your preflight loop to get the best connection every time. ```openaps alias add preflight '! bash -c "echo -n \"mmtune: \" && openaps mmtune && echo -n \"PREFLIGHT \" && openaps report invoke monitor/temp_basal.json 2>/dev/null >/dev/null && echo -n \"OK, temp duration check \" && cat monitor/temp_basal.json | json -c \"this.duration < 25\" | grep -q duration && echo OK || ( echo FAIL; sleep 120; exit 1 )"'```. Be sure to remove your old preflight if you have one first and then make sure it's added into whatever your cron sequence is. Also, make sure to switch temp_basal.json to whatever your temp basal file is called/located.
